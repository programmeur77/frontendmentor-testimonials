          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          curren, if no more so, in the company I joined. I honnestly feel I got
          every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          lokking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! The next 12 week was the best - and most
          grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup."

          "Before joining the bootcam, I've never written a line of code! I
          needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former by a
          former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curiculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait for long to get assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. I
          fact, I've often reffer to it during during interviews as an example
          of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
          full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommended!"
